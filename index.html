<body>
<p>My name is Austin Michels and I am 20 years old. I was born April 2nd, 1998 at Eastside hospital in Snellville, GA.
I grew up in Lilburn, GA where i spent much of my time playing baseball. I began playing basbeall out of Bethesda park and the Brookwood 
district before moving to Mountian Park and the Parkview district where I went to school. I played throughtout highschool at 
	<a href="http://www.parkviewbaseball.com class="button"> Parkview Highschool </a> winning two National Championships before hurting my arm
and quitting senior year. </p>
	
<p>After quitting baseball, I began working valet at the Omni Hotel in downtown Atlanta. I soon became a valet manager and managed 
at the Omni until May 2017, about a year and a half after I began working there. I was then offered a job in Dallas, Texas, but turned it down
to stay in Atlanta and open a new hotel. I then managed the valet at the new AC Hotel in downtown Atlanta and watched it become the fastest 
growing hotel in Atlanta. I worked at the AC Hotel until August 2018 when I moved to Athens and began at UGA. I had previously taken classes
at GGC until transferring to UGA. I am currently a junior at UGA majoring in Accounting where I hope to work for a company in the
liquor or beer industry.
